	<h1>Background</h1>
	<p>Research in the area of recommender systems is largely focused on helping individual users finding items they are interested in. This is usually done by learning to rank the recommendable items based on their assumed relevance for each user. The implicit underlying goal of a such system is to affect users in different positive ways, e.g., by making their search and decision processes easier or by helping them discover new things.</p>
	<p>Recommender systems can, however, also have other more directly-measurable impacts, e.g., such that go beyond the individual user or the short term influence. A recommender system on a news platform, for example, can lead to a shift in the reading patterns of the entire user base. Similarly, on e-commerce platforms, it has been shown that a recommender can induce significant changes in the purchase behavior of consumers, leading, for example, to generally higher sales diversity across the site. On the other hand, recommender systems usually serve certain business goals and can have an impact not only on the customers, e.g., by stimulating higher engagement on a media streaming platform or a social network, but also direct and indirect affect sales, revenue or conversion and churn rates.</p>

<a id="goals"></a> 
	<h1>Goals of the Workshop</h1>
	<p>The research literature that considers such more direct measurements of impact of recommender systems on the various stakeholders is comparably scarce and scattered. With the proposed workshop, we pursue different goals.</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>First, the workshop will serve as a platform where researchers can present their latest works in which they analyzed different forms of impact of recommenders. We consider both papers where impact on individual users was measured (e.g., more healthy eating habits that were stimulated by a food recommender or a more efficient choice process), papers that highlight effects on a  community or a society as a whole, and papers that demonstrate effects in terms of  business value.</li>
	<li>Second, the goal of the interactive session is to explore new ways how the impact of recommender systems can be measured within academic settings, i.e., were some impacts can only be analyzed based on simulations or alternative computational measures.</li>
	<li>Third, the workshop shall serve as an instrument to raise awareness in the community regarding the importance of impact-oriented research. This aspect in our view is particularly important as more and more research works indicate that optimizing for the most accurate prediction not necessarily leads to the best recommendations in terms of the users' quality perception or the desired effects of a recommender.</li>
	</ul>

<a id="topics"></a>
	<h1>Topics</h1>
	<p>The topics of interest include, e.g.,
	<ul>
	<li>Field studies on the impact and business value of recommender systems</li>
	<li>Offline evaluation protocols and measures to assess the impact or recommenders</li>
	<li>User studies on the effects of recommenders on users, e.g., on decision making</li>
	<li>Simulation-based approaches to impact assessment</li>
	<li>Price- and profit-awareness of recommender systems</li>
	<li>Network effects of recommender systems</li>
	<li>Multi-stakeholder recommender systems</li>
	<li>Beyond accuracy optimization methods for recommender systems (e.g., business metrics, user satisfaction)</li>
	<li>Long-term implications of deployed recommender systems</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
